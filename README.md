# nlp-basics-hacker-hour
Demo of natural language processing basics like preprocessing, text representation and vectorization, TF-IDF, and cosine similarity done through a text analysis of presidential inaugural speeches using R. The inaugural speeches are acquired using the quanteda package in R and analysis is done using the tidytext package. 

To explore the code, download R and RStudio and clone this repository. If interested, I also preprocessed all State of the Union speeches at the end of the notebook. Try applying the techniques for analyzing the inaugural speeches to State of the Union speeches.   

This demo was done for a Hacker Hour talk I gave for Rutgers USACS. Look at the slides for background information on the demo. Resources I used to compile this demo include coursework from Intro to Data Science and Computational Social Science, TowardsDataScience on Medium, and Tidy Text Mining.
